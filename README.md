# This is a fork of the AV1 branch of the very well made campy repository
For the actual repository, see https://github.com/ksseverson57/campy

This fork was made because some more recent changes broke some functionality as of June 9 2025. Likely those breaks could be mended by using an updated version of everything, but if you want a version that is guaranteed to work on Sponberg lab computers, here it is. Eventually we should move to the full repo

# This is an experimental branch currently being tested
# Preparing new release (2.1.0) Fall 2023
- Added AV1 encoding support for better streaming quality per bit rate (see examples) \
  Note: AV1 decoding may be slower than H264/265
- Added constant bitrate (cbr) mode \
  With cbr, video files can be compressed consistently with minimal loss in visual quality \
  However, constant quality (constqp) mode can compress with fewer artifacts in frames with rapid motion
- Integrated Basler pypylon zero-copy to reduce overhead
- Re-worked closeout sequence to improve synchronicity when recording is interrupted by user (Ctrl+C)
- Unified display window across camera APIs using opencv
- Added seamless chunking to split video into multiple files (see help for "chunkLengthInFrames")
- Replaced config parameter "chunkLengthInFrames" with "displayFrameCounter" for reporting FPS and recording progress
- Added support for non-integer frame rates \
  Trigger module now passes inter-frame interval in microseconds rather than frame rate to microcontroller \
  ** Re-upload trigger.ino if updating to campy 2.1 if using campy's included trigger module
- Minor bug fixes

# campy
- Python package for acquiring and compressing video from multiple cameras

## Hardware/Software Recommendations
- Basler and/or FLIR machine vision camera(s)
- Windows, IOS, or Linux system
- (Optional) Server/workstation class CPUs with >=4 memory channels (e.g., AMD Threadripper 3995WX, Intel i9-10900X) can increase bandwidth over consumer CPUs with 2 memory channels (more cameras, higher resolution/frame rate)
- (Optional) USB expansion card with 1 host controller per camera (e.g., Basler USB 3.0, 4X PCIe, 4X HC, 4 Ports PN# 2000036233)
- (Optional) Hardware encoder using AMD, Intel, or Nvidia GPU (see https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-decode-gpu-support-matrix)
- (Optional) Arduino/Teensy/Pi microcontroller for syncing cameras and other devices

## Installation
1. Update graphics drivers
2. Create and activate a new Python Anaconda environment:
```
conda create -n campy python=3.8 imageio-ffmpeg -c conda-forge
conda activate campy
pip install -U setuptools
```
3. Install camera software
- If using Basler cameras, install Pylon software:
  - Install Basler Pylon with Developer options
  - Install pypylon:
  Windows:
  ```
  pip install pypylon
  ```
  Linux:
  ```
  conda install swig
  git clone https://github.com/basler/pypylon.git
  python ./pypylon/setup.py install
  ```
  
- If using FLIR cameras:
  - Download and install Spinnaker SDK and SpinView software from FLIR's website: 
    https://www.flir.com/products/spinnaker-sdk
  - Manually install binary wheel for PySpin (included in the Spinnaker download)
    E.g. for Python 3.7 on Windows amd64 system, install "spinnaker_python-2.3.0.77-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl"
  ```
  pip3 install <wheel>
  ```
4. Clone or download campy to local folder:
```
git clone -b AV1 â€”single-branch https://github.com/ksseverson57/campy.git
```
5. Finally, install campy and its dependencies (see setup.py) by navigating to campy folder:
```
pip install -e .
```

6. (Optional) Install your ffmpeg build of choice (e.g., 6.0.0 includes AV1 encoding support; however 4.2.2 supports h264/h265 best)
```
conda install ffmpeg==6.0.0 -c conda-forge
```
- Include in config.yaml:
```
ffmpegPath: "/path/to/ffmpeg.exe"
```

## Usage

### Configuration
- Edit the config.yaml file to customize your system and recording configuration
- For Basler cameras, use the Pylon Viewer to configure and save your '.pfs' camera settings file. Examples are included in campy/configs.
- Several example config files are located in campy/configs
- For help setting config parameters:
```
campy-acquire --help
```

- Campy can be configured to stop automatically after set recording time (e.g. 1 hour):
```
recTimeInSeconds: 3600
```
- Campy can be configured to save seamlessly "chunked" video files:
```
chunkLengthInSec: 60
```
- Single parameters will be applied to all cameras; lists will be applied to each camera in order provided:
```
cameraNames: ["Camera0", "Camera1"]
cameraSelection: [0, 1]
cameraSettings: ["./cam_1152x1024.pfs", "./cam_1536x1152.pfs"]
frameRate: 100
frameWidth: [1152, 1536]
frameHeight: [1024, 1152]
gpuID: [0, 1]
codec: "h265"
quality: "8M"
preset: "llhq"
```

### Camera Triggering
Campy's trigger module supports Arduino and Teensy microcontrollers:
1. Download Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). If using Teensy, install Teensyduino (https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html).
2. Connect your microcontroller and note its port number (e.g. "COM3" on Windows or "/dev/ttyACM0" on Linux).
3. In your config.yaml, configure:
```
startArduino: True 
digitalPins: [<pin IDs>] # e.g. [0,1,2]
serialPort: "<port>" # e.g. "COM3" or "/dev/ttyACM0"
```
4. Open and upload "trigger.ino" file (in campy/trigger folder) to your board. Make sure serial monitor is closed while using pyserial connection.
5. Campy will synchronously trigger the cameras once acquisition has initialized.

### Start Recording:
```
campy-acquire ./configs/campy_config.yaml
```

### Stop Recording:
- To manually end the recording, press Ctrl^C. Wait until campy exits! Campy will attempt to empty the frames in the buffers before saving the video files
- Metadata files "frametimes.mat", "frametimes.csv", "writer_frametimes.csv", and "metadata.csv", will be saved along with the video file in each camera folder containing timestamps, frame numbers, and the campy config parameters.

### Helpful Tips
- If campy drops frames, hangs upon exiting, or memory usage ramps up during acquisition, your acquisition performance may be bottlenecked
  - See hardware recommendations above to address USB and CPU bandwidth limitations
  - Lower frame rate or resolution of each camera to a sustainable level
  - Try different pixel formats (e.g., "yuv420", "nv12", "rgb0")
  - Try lowering "preset" to "fast" if GPU encoder is limiting (observe "Video Encoder" usage in Windows Task Manager or other HW monitoring utility)

- Check that your cameras and features can be loaded in the camera vendor's GUI (e.g. Pylon Viewer for Basler or SpinView for FLIR).
- If errors arise when campy loads camera settings, try replugging camera USB cables

- If your compression streams are limited to 5 random cameras, it could be due to hard limit of 5 simultaneous encoding streams per system when using NVIDIA Geforce cards
- Tesla/Quadro cards are typically unrestricted
- NVIDIA driver patch can circumvent this restriction

- To debug broken ffmpeg pipe error, set the ffmpeg log level in config.yaml:
```
ffmpegLogLevel: "warning"
```
or
```
ffmpegLogLevel: "info"
```
- Use the command "ffmpeg" to check enabled packages. Hardware encoder support must be enabled in your ffmpeg binary
- Windows ffmpeg binary installed by Anaconda should support hardware encoder by default (e.g., "--enable-nvenc")
- On Linux, you may need to compile your own ffmpeg binary to enable certain codecs, filters, or plugins:
- Nvidia:
```
git clone https://git.videolan.org/git/ffmpeg/nv-codec-headers.git
cd nv-codec-headers && sudo make install && cd ..
```
- Intel:
```
sudo apt-get install libva-dev libmfx-dev libx264-dev libx265-dev libnuma-dev
```
- AMD:
```
git clone https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/AMF.git
sudo cp -r ./AMF/amf/public/include/core /usr/include/AMF
sudo cp -r ./AMF/amf/public/include/components /usr/include/AMF
```
- Compile ffmpeg:
```
git clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git
cd ffmpeg
sudo ./configure \
--enable-cuda --enable-cuvid --enable-nvdec --enable-nvenc --enable-nonfree \
--extra-cflags=-I/usr/local/cuda/include --extra-ldflags=-L/usr/local/cuda/lib64 \
--enable-gpl --enable-libx264 --enable-libx265 --enable-libmfx \
--enable-amf
sudo make -j -s
sudo cp -r ./ffmpeg /usr/bin
```
- Include in config.yaml:
```
ffmpegPath: "/usr/bin/ffmpeg"
```
